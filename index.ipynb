    "In this lab we are going to practice working with creating a RESTful API that returns data about Tweets and Users. In this domain Users will have many Tweets and Tweets will, therefore, belong to a User. We will be using the `flask-sqlalchemy` module to make our models, schema, and connect to our SQLite database. Then we will define RESTful routes and functions that Query our database and return JSON data for each resource. Let's get started!"

    "We will need to connect our Flask app to a database to both persist data to use later on and return data for our request resources. In order to do this, we will need to set up SQLAlchemy. Thankfully, there is a module that makes this helps with this set-up process. First we will need to `pip install flask_sqlalchemy`. Then we will need to update our imports so that we can use this module. In the app.py file, your imports should look like the following:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    from flask import Flask, jsonify\n",
    "    from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we can instantiate an new instance of Flask for our `app` like we do for all of our Flask apps. Then we need to add some configuration to our app in addition to telling the app to run with `'DEBUG' = True`. We need to also tell our app where its SQLite database is. So your app's code should look like the following:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    # initialize new flask app\n",
    "    app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "    # add configurations and database URI\n",
    "    app.config['DEBUG'] = True\n",
    "    app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///app.db'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to connect SQLAlchemy to our application and create our database object, (`db`). So, we are going to take our new Flask app and use it as an argument for our SQLAlchemy module. We will set the return value to the variable `db` so we can continue to interact with our database like we have in our lessons on SQLAlchemy. Your code should now include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    # connect flask_sqlalchemy to the configured flask app\n",
    "    db = SQLAlchemy(app)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll see that our models are already provided for us. In order to successfully create our tables in our newly connected database, we will need to use our `db` object and call the `create_all` function somewhere after we define our models.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look at the seed.py file, we see that we have some data already provided for us and the `db.create_all()` function is being called there before we try to create any information in our database. Run this file by writing \n",
    "`python seed.py` in your terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** Since flask_sqlalchemy contains the session object for our application, we reference it by calling `session` on our `db` object like so: `db.session`. Similarly, when we want to add our newly created objects to our database, we call `db.session.add()` and commit the new objects by calling `db.session.commit()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This pattern continues to our definition of models and table columns as we can see. Recall from SQLAlchemy that our models inherited from the `Base` class.  Now they will inherit from our conjoined Flask and SQLAlchemy object.  In our class definitions for our Tweet and User models, we give the argument of `db.Model`.  We add columns by calling `db.Column()`. Finally, defining the datatype for a column is also done by calling `db.Integer`, `db.String`, or more generally `db.[data_type]` and providing the desired datatype.\n",
    "\n",
    "```pyhon\n",
    "class User(db.Model):\n",
    "    __tablename__ = 'users'\n",
    "    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)\n",
    "    username = db.Column(db.String(20), nullable=False)\n",
    "    tweets = db.relationship('Tweet', backref='users', lazy=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, remember to start the server by adding the following command below our routes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    app.run()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can start our server by running `python app.py` in the terminal.  If you see a FSADeprecationWarning and your server doesn't start, simply add the following line to your Flask app configuration:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "app.config['SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS'] = False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And that's it! Now we need go back to our `app.py` file and create our routes. We'll be using the seed data we just created to return as JSON in our routes.  Remember that we are building an API containing JSON, so `'/api/'` should be prepended to each URL."
